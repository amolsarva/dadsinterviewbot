This app runs *without* any environment variables (demo mode).
If you want real storage/email/AI later, here are the keys:
- OPENAI_API_KEY: optional; enables real follow-up generation
- SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (or SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY): required for Supabase storage access
- SUPABASE_STORAGE_BUCKET (or SUPABASE_BUCKET): bucket where session manifests + primers are stored
- SUPABASE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL (optional): override the download host if you proxy blob URLs elsewhere
- Netlify aliases (`NETLIFY_SUPABASE_*` / `NETLIFY_ENV_SUPABASE_*`) and legacy `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*` variants are recognised automatically if you've already stored secrets that way (still prefer the service-role key).
- RESEND_API_KEY: optional; sends the summary email on finalize
- DEFAULT_NOTIFY_EMAIL: server-side default recipient (fallback: a@sarva.co)
- NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME and patience knobs are optional for UI

Demo mode behavior without keys:
- AI follow-ups are mocked.
- Artifacts are generated as data: URLs (still visible in History/Session).
- Email is skipped with a log note; no error thrown.

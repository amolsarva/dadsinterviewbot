This app now requires Netlify blob credentials for persistent storage.
If you want real storage/email/AI later, here are the keys:
- OPENAI_API_KEY: optional; enables real follow-up generation
- NETLIFY_BLOBS_SITE_ID and NETLIFY_BLOBS_TOKEN: required for Netlify blob storage access
- NETLIFY_BLOBS_STORE (optional): overrides the default blob store name
- NETLIFY_BLOBS_API_URL / NETLIFY_BLOBS_EDGE_URL (optional): advanced overrides for self-managed deployments
- NETLIFY_BLOBS_PUBLIC_BASE_URL (optional): use a custom absolute/relative URL for blob downloads
- RESEND_API_KEY: optional; sends the summary email on finalize
- DEFAULT_NOTIFY_EMAIL: server-side default recipient (fallback: a@sarva.co)
- NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME and patience knobs are optional for UI

Behavior without storage keys:
- AI follow-ups are mocked.
- Storage operations fail with a critical diagnostics alert until Netlify credentials are provided.
- Email is skipped with a log note; no error thrown.

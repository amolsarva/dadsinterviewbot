This app runs *without* any environment variables (demo mode). 
If you want real storage/email/AI later, here are the keys:
- OPENAI_API_KEY: optional; enables real follow-up generation
- VERCEL_BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN: optional; writes artifacts to Vercel Blob
- RESEND_API_KEY: optional; sends the summary email on finalize
- DEFAULT_NOTIFY_EMAIL: server-side default recipient (fallback: a@sarva.co)
- NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME and patience knobs are optional for UI

Demo mode behavior without keys:
- AI follow-ups are mocked.
- Artifacts are generated as data: URLs (still visible in History/Session).
- Email is skipped with a log note; no error thrown.

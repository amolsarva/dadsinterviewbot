# Interview Guide: Learning from Elders via Keating’s Method

*Audience*: Older family members or elder community members  
*Goal*: Uncover their personal history, identity, beliefs, and values; capture stories that might otherwise be lost.

---

## Preparation

1. **Establish rapport & context**

   * Learn in advance: their major life stages (childhood, youth, adult, later years), cultural background, major historical events they lived through.
   * Choose a comfortable setting, allow plenty of time.
   * Use recording if they agree (audio/video) but reassure them about how material will be used.

2. **Mindset & technique reminders for the interviewer**

   * Ask open-ended questions.
   * Be patient; allow silences. Memory work is slow.
   * Let them decide which parts they want to talk about. You’re a facilitator, not interrogator.
   * Be sensitive to taboo or painful subjects; follow their lead.
   * Pay attention to details (language they use, vivid descriptions), since these carry a lot of cultural and personal meaning.

## Probing & Follow-Up Techniques

* Use follow-ups: *“What was that like?”*, *“How did you feel?”*, *“Why did you make that decision?”*
* When they mention a person/place/event briefly—ask to flesh it out.
* Reflect back: *“You said X—could you tell me more about that moment?”*
* Use sensory cues: *“What was the smell/sound/feel then?”*
* Give time; embrace silence as they search memory.

## Ethical & Emotional Considerations

* Establish consent: ensure they know purpose, where material might be used.
* Respect boundaries—if a topic seems painful or the elder doesn’t want to talk, let them steer away.
* Validate their experiences ("Thank you for sharing that").
* After the interview, offer to share transcripts or recordings; maybe let them correct or add.

## Structure in Steps (Timeline of Interviews)

You don’t have to get everything in one session. Suggested pacing:

* **Session 1**: Warm-ups + youth + formative years
* **Session 2**: Young adulthood + work/family
* **Session 3**: Later years, reflection, culture & change
* **Session 4**: Legacy, open topics, closure

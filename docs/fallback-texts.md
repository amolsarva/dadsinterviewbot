# Fallback Text Inventory

This file is the single source of truth for every hard-coded fallback phrase in the app. Update the JSON block below and run `pnpm fallback:sync` to regenerate the TypeScript helpers that power the runtime code. Strings may contain named placeholders wrapped in braces (for example `{DATE}` or `{DETAIL}`) that the code replaces at runtime. Each entry includes a quick reference to the modules that consume it so you can review usage in context.

      "What feeling rushed in right away?",
      "Is there a small sound or scent that still brings it back to you?",
      "Was there an object in the room that now holds extra meaning for you?",
      "What was happening just a few moments before everything began?",
      "How did the light or weather color that scene for you?",
